# homework-1
This repository is used for my first homework asignment from the coding bootcamp.
This weeks assignment was optimizing and slight bug fixing for an html and css for a pre-existing code.
Much of the code was poorly structured with non semantic html tags used to describe the site, and although functional, it didn't meet proper accesibility protocols.
Certain functions of the site also didn't work properly, and image elements were missing alt tags required for accesibility.
The CSS sheet was also poorly structured and contained several reduntant tags that needed to be consolidated.

## Fixes and changes made to html and css

```
-fixed title of site
-replaced all instances of div and span tags with proper semantic tags
-fixed broken search engine optimization link
-added descriptive alt tags to images used on the site
-re-named a few classes used to be more semantically correct
-consolidated a few css tags and re-structured the page slightly to flow better and remove redundancy
-added notes to the html and css sheet to make code more readable
```

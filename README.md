# homework-1
This repository is used for my first homework asignment from the coding bootcamp.
This weeks assignment was optimizing and slight bug fixing for an html and css for a pre-existing code.
Much of the code was poorly structured with non semantic html tags used to describe the site, and although functional, it didn't meet proper accesibility protocols.
Certain functions of the site also didn't work properly, and image elements were missing alt tags required for accesibility.
The CSS sheet was also poorly structured and contained several reduntant tags that needed to be consolidated.


The first thing I did in fixing the page and bringing it up to standard was fixing the broken link element and adding in the alt text that was missing on the images, along with fixing the title for the website.
After doing that I started the process of trying to replace all of the div tags with tags that were semantically correct.
Several of these I was able to do just using the information on the html page and refering to the class tags already in use, though for some cases I used external resources to try and figure out what proper semantics should be used.
Once I had most of them figured out, I started working on re-structuring th css page to remove reduntantcies and re-name certain classes to unify some lines of styling, this resulted in a much shorter and more concise css.
Finally, I went back through and finished switching out non semantic tags and added in notes for the html page and css page.
